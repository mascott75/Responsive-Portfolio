# Responsive-Portfolio, this website hold my contact information (kinda), my portfolio with areas to input projects I have created, and an about-me page with general information about latin sounding words. 

# all pages were made with a grid system. The header/nav-bar is made of one row with two collumns. the footer is one row and one collumn. 

# The about-me page has a Bootstrap card that has two rows. The first row is one collumn and holds the heading. The second row has two collumns, one for the picture, and one for the text.

# Portfolio page is made of one container, and one row with 5 collumns in it.

# Contact page has a contact card from Bootstrap that has multiple rows, with multiple collumns, that create the grid. The main area is a collumn, and in it are three rows. in each row, there's a different ammount of collumns that create input boxes and text boxes.
